Welcome to the Escape Ikea game.

Carmona is new in town, and the room he just moved in has everything he needs, but there's no pillow.
Carmona decides that the easiest way to get a pillow is going to Ikea.

This is a horrible mistake.

Your goal is to navigate through Ikea without getting ANY other crap.
You just need a pillow.

Avoid wasting your money with the shiny stuff Ikea will throw at you.

You know you can't control yourself. If you get too close to the shelfs, you'll buy something you don't need. Avoid it at all costs.
